#  Flick Test

The goal of this app is to experiment with CALayer and see if I can create a card
interface exclusively using CALayers.

The card will

- have text in it
- have rounded corners

When you tap left or right on the keyboard, the card will be flicked to the left or right
and rotate as it drops down.

As a stretch goal, it would be great if the card "dropped" like gravity was pulling down.
